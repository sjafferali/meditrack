# GitHub Actions Workflow Fix for UI Updates

## Problem Identified

We've identified an issue with the Docker image build process in the GitHub Actions workflow. UI improvements made to the codebase are not appearing in the deployed application when using the Docker image from Docker Hub (`sjafferali/meditrack:latest`).

## Root Cause

After investigating the GitHub Actions workflow and Docker build process, we found that:

1. The current workflow does not properly build the frontend before building the Docker image.
2. The Docker build context is set to the root directory (`.`), but the Dockerfile might be expecting pre-built frontend files.
3. As a result, the Docker image may not include the latest UI changes from the frontend codebase.

## Solution

We've created a comprehensive fix that addresses both the GitHub Actions workflow and provides a way to update existing deployments:

### 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow

The `.github/workflows/main.yml.updated` file includes these key improvements:

- Explicitly builds the frontend before building the Docker image
- Copies the built frontend files to the backend static directory
- Sets the Docker build context to the backend directory
- Adds a SHA tag to the Docker image for better versioning
- Verifies the static files are correctly included in the Docker image

### 2. Script for Existing Deployments

For existing deployments, we've created `update_existing_deployment.sh`, which:

- Clones the repository to get the latest code
- Builds the frontend locally
- Copies the built files directly into the running Docker container
- Restarts the container to apply the changes

### 3. Updated Docker Compose File

We've also created `docker-compose.production.yml`, which:

- Only mounts the database directory, not the static files
- Ensures the static files in the Docker image are used
- Maintains the same environment variables and settings

## How to Fix Your Deployment

You have two options:

### Option 1: Update the Running Container (Quick Fix)

```bash
chmod +x update_existing_deployment.sh
./update_existing_deployment.sh meditrackgigi
```

This script will rebuild the frontend and copy the files directly into your running container, then restart it. This is a quick solution that doesn't require waiting for a new Docker image to be built.

### Option 2: Update GitHub Actions and Rebuild (Permanent Fix)

1. Replace your `.github/workflows/main.yml` file with the updated version:

```bash
mv .github/workflows/main.yml.updated .github/workflows/main.yml
git add .github/workflows/main.yml
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Actions workflow for UI updates"
git push
```

2. Wait for the GitHub Actions workflow to build and push a new Docker image

3. Pull and use the new Docker image:

```bash
docker pull sjafferali/meditrack:latest
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

## Prevention for Future Updates

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. Always use the production Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.production.yml`) that doesn't mount static files
2. Ensure the GitHub Actions workflow explicitly builds the frontend before the Docker image
3. Use versioned tags (like the SHA tag added in the updated workflow) for better tracking of changes

## Verification

After applying either fix, you should see:

1. The correct dropdown width for the person selector (fixed 200px width for the button)
2. Proper spacing between the person name and "Default" label
3. The person selection modal closer to the top of the screen
4. The Select button size consistent with other buttons
