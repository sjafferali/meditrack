# MediTrack Static File Deployment Fix

## Problem Identified

The UI improvements that were made to the codebase are not appearing in the deployed application, despite the build process supposedly building the static files during Docker image creation.

After investigation, we discovered that when using the standard Docker deployment setup, the static files from the container are not correctly being updated. This issue occurs because the Docker image correctly builds and includes the newest static files, but they are not visible in the deployed application.

## Root Cause

The issue is related to how the application is deployed using Docker Compose. The current `docker-compose.simple.yml` file specifies a volume mount for the data directory:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./data:/app/data
```

While this correctly persists the database, it doesn't ensure that the static files in the Docker image are used. The application is configured to serve static files from the `/app/static` directory, but those files in the built Docker image might not be accessible after deployment.

The build process defined in the `Dockerfile` does correctly copy the built frontend files to the backend static directory. However, during deployment, the container might be using outdated static files, especially if a previous deployment created a volume that shadows the container's built-in static files.

## Solution

We've created a new approach to ensure that the latest static files are always used when deploying the application:

1. We've created a new `docker-compose.production.yml` file that only mounts the data directory and doesn't interfere with the static files built into the Docker image.

2. We've developed a comprehensive script (`fix_static_file_deployment.sh`) that:
   - Cleans up any existing containers
   - Rebuilds the frontend code
   - Copies the built files to the backend static directory
   - Builds a new Docker image that includes these files
   - Deploys the application using the production configuration

The key difference is that this approach ensures the Docker image itself contains the correct static files, and when deployed, those files are used without being overwritten or shadowed by volume mounts.

## How to Apply This Fix

1. Run the fix script:

```bash
chmod +x fix_static_file_deployment.sh
./fix_static_file_deployment.sh
```

2. For future deployments, always use the production configuration:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

## Prevention for Future Updates

When making UI changes in the future:

1. Update the source code in the frontend directory
2. Rebuild the Docker image completely (don't rely on mounted volumes for static files)
3. Deploy using the production Docker Compose file

This ensures that the Docker image contains the latest compiled static files and that those files are correctly served when the container runs.

## Verification

After applying the fix, you should:

1. See the correct dropdown width for the person selector (fixed 200px width for the button)
2. Have proper spacing between the person name and "Default" label
3. See the person selection modal closer to the top of the screen
4. Notice the Select button size is consistent with other buttons

All of these UI improvements were already in the source code but were not being correctly deployed to the static files served by the application.

## Additional Notes

- For development, you can continue to use `start_dev.sh` or the standard Docker Compose file, as dynamic reloading is more important than consistent builds in that environment.
- If your deployment environment uses multiple services or containers, adapt the production Docker Compose file accordingly, but maintain the principle of not mounting volumes that would override the built static files.
