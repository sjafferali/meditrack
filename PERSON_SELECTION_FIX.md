# Person Selection Fix

## Issue Description

When users visited the application, they were presented with a welcome screen with a "Manage People" button. After clicking the button, the Person Manager dialog would open, but there was no obvious way to actually select a person from this dialog - it only had options to edit, delete, or set a person as default.

## Applied Fixes

1. Added a prominent "Select" button for each person in the Person Manager dialog:
   ```tsx
   <button
     onClick={() => {
       onPersonChange(person.id);
       onClose();
     }}
     className="bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white px-3 py-1 rounded"
   >
     Select
   </button>
   ```

2. Made the UI elements wrap properly with `flex-wrap`:
   ```tsx
   <div className="flex items-center gap-2 flex-wrap">
   ```

3. Added explanatory text at the top of the Person Manager dialog:
   ```tsx
   <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Select a person to manage their medications or add a new person.</p>
   ```

4. Updated the welcome screen with clearer instructions and renamed the button:
   ```tsx
   <p className="mb-2">Welcome to MediTrack! Click the button below to select a person and manage their medications.</p>
   <button className="...">Select Person</button>
   ```

## Verification

The fix was verified by:

1. Building and deploying the frontend
2. Confirming the updated UI elements appear correctly
3. Testing the person selection flow:
   - Opening the welcome screen
   - Clicking "Select Person"
   - Seeing the person manager with "Select" buttons
   - Clicking "Select" on a person
   - Confirming medications load correctly

## Test Steps

1. Open the application in your browser
2. You should see a welcome screen with a "Select Person" button
3. Click the button to open the person manager dialog
4. Each person in the list should have a clear "Select" button
5. Click "Select" on a person to load their medications
