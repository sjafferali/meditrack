# Static Files CI/CD Fix

## Problem Identified

UI changes (like modal positioning and styling) were not being reflected in the deployed application, despite the codebase having the correct changes. This issue occurred because:

1. The GitHub Actions workflow was using a custom `Dockerfile.ci` for building the Docker image
2. This custom Dockerfile had issues with how it handled static files from the frontend build
3. The Docker image wasn't correctly incorporating the latest frontend static files

## Solution

The workflow has been updated to:

1. Remove the custom `Dockerfile.ci` that had issues
2. Use the main `Dockerfile` that correctly incorporates the frontend static files using multi-stage builds
3. Add verification steps to ensure static files are properly set up before building
4. Use the standard Docker build process to ensure frontend files are properly included

## Technical Details

The issue stemmed from how static files were being handled in the CI/CD pipeline:

1. The frontend was correctly built during CI
2. The built files were copied to the backend's static directory
3. BUT: The custom CI Dockerfile then had issues copying these files into the final image

The fix ensures that:
- We verify static files exist before attempting to build the Docker image
- We use the main Dockerfile that correctly handles static files using multi-stage builds
- The final Docker image properly contains all the latest frontend code

## Future Deployments

To update your deployment with these fixes:

1. Push this change to your main branch
2. Let GitHub Actions build a new Docker image
3. Pull the latest image in your deployment environment with:
   ```
   docker pull sjafferali/meditrack:latest
   ```
4. Update your container using the new image:
   ```
   docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
   ```

## Verification

After deploying the new image, you should see:
1. The person management modal appears at the top of the screen (fixed positioning)
2. Proper spacing between person name and "Default" label
3. Consistent button sizing throughout the application

If you need to verify static files in the container, you can use:
```
docker exec CONTAINER_NAME ls -la /app/app/static
```

## Additional Notes

The `update_existing_deployment.sh` script remains available as a fallback method for updating static files in a running container, but with this CI/CD fix, you should no longer need it for newly built images.
