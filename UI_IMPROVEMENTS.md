# MediTrack UI Improvements

## Person Manager Screen Enhancements

The Person Manager screen has been redesigned for improved clarity, functionality, and user experience.

### Before:
- "Default" label was placed awkwardly inline with action buttons
- Action buttons were all in a single row, with no visual hierarchy
- UI was cluttered with all elements competing for attention
- Dialog header and instructions were minimal

### After:

#### Layout Improvements:
1. **Improved Card Layout**:
   - Responsive design that adapts to screen size
   - Person name and Default label placed together at the top
   - Information organized in logical sections

2. **Visual Hierarchy**:
   - Primary "Select" button is now prominent and positioned separately
   - Secondary actions (Edit, Delete, Set Default) in a separate section at the bottom
   - Clear separation between information and actions

3. **Clear Styling**:
   - "Default" label redesigned as a pill badge next to the person's name
   - More consistent button styling with hover effects
   - Added subtle hover shadow effect to cards

#### Functional Improvements:
1. **More Intuitive Header**:
   - Changed dialog title from "Manage People" to "Select a Person" for clarity
   - Styled header with a light blue background to differentiate it

2. **Enhanced Help Text**:
   - Added an information box with clear instructions
   - Styled with an icon and blue background for visibility
   - Explicit mention of the "Select" button to guide users

3. **Improved Button Layout**:
   - Prominent "Select" button with arrow icon for main action
   - Secondary actions in a separate bottom section
   - "Add New Person" button is centered and more attention-grabbing
   - Delete confirmation is now clearly labeled as "Confirm Delete"

4. **Improved Spacing and Organization**:
   - Consistent padding and spacing throughout
   - Clear visual separation between cards
   - Responsive design that works well on mobile and desktop
   - Proper button grouping and alignment

5. **Added Visual Cues**:
   - Transition effects for a more polished feel
   - Hover states for all interactive elements
   - Arrow icon in Select button to indicate action

These improvements make the person selection process more intuitive and user-friendly while addressing the specific issue with the awkwardly placed "Default" label.
