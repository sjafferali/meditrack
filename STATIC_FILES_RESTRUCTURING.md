# Static Files Restructuring

## Problem Identified

The application had a nested static file structure that was causing issues:

1. React build created files in `frontend/build/static/js` and `frontend/build/static/css`
2. These were copied to the backend as `backend/app/static/static/js` and `backend/app/static/static/css`
3. FastAPI then mounted `backend/app/static/static` as `/static`
4. This resulted in a redundant path structure and potential path resolution issues

## Solution

We have restructured the static files to use a more logical directory structure:

### Before:
```
backend/app/static/
├── index.html
├── asset-manifest.json
└── static/
    ├── js/
    │   ├── main.*.js
    │   ├── main.*.js.map
    │   └── person-initializer.js
    └── css/
        ├── main.*.css
        └── main.*.css.map
```

### After:
```
backend/app/static/
├── index.html
├── asset-manifest.json
├── js/
│   ├── main.*.js
│   ├── main.*.js.map
│   └── person-initializer.js
├── css/
│   ├── main.*.css
│   └── main.*.css.map
└── assets/
    └── media/ (if any media files exist)
```

## Technical Details

The following changes were made:

1. Modified FastAPI static file mounting in `backend/app/main.py`:
   - Changed to mount `/js`, `/css`, and `/assets` paths directly
   - Removed the redundant static/static nesting

2. Updated the CI/CD workflow to:
   - Create a flattened directory structure
   - Copy files to their appropriate locations
   - Update path references in index.html

3. Updated the Dockerfile to:
   - Create the new directory structure
   - Copy files directly to their final locations
   - Update path references in index.html

## Benefits

This restructuring:
- Eliminates redundant paths
- Makes the codebase more maintainable
- Improves readability of the static file structure
- Follows standard web practices for static assets organization
- Prevents potential path resolution issues

## Verification

After deploying with this new structure, verify that:
1. The application loads correctly
2. All JavaScript and CSS files are properly loaded
3. No console errors related to file loading
4. All UI elements appear and function correctly
