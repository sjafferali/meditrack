## Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- Backend: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + SQLite
- Frontend: React (existing TSX component)
- Deployment: Docker + Docker Compose
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

### Development Workflow
1. Complete backend API
2. Write tests for backend
3. Update frontend to use API
4. Containerize application
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline
6. Document deployment process

### Time Estimate
- Backend Development: 8-10 hours
- Frontend Integration: 4-6 hours
- Testing: 4-6 hours
- DevOps Setup: 4-6 hours
- Documentation: 2-3 hours
- **Total MVP: 22-31 hours**
